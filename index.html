            <p>As a past member of AIGA DC, a current member of Where Are All the Black Designers, and the only Black person in the MPS program, I definitely feel the pressure of being part of the 4% of Black designers in academic and professional spaces.

                I have definitely felt the “normalized feeling of alienation” that Harris speaks about. Sometimes it feels like the design world wasn't made for people like me. When I received my acceptance letter for the MPS program, I was extremely proud to be a member of the student body. However, my excitement quickly faded during orientation when I was humbled by the challenges ahead. After overcoming much adversity, I’ve found that I have a long journey ahead of me. I feel like there are subtle micro aggressions that I’ve encountered as a Black designer. 
                
                Sometimes when I'm on campus I get mistaken for being an employee rather than a masters student. When I tell other students that I’m part of the MPS program, I’ve gotten questions like, “That’s a really competitive program—why did they accept you?” Designing while Black isn't just about scraping your way to the top; it’s about constantly defending your worth, credentials, and identity at every step in your career.
                
                I appreciated Harris’ effort in spotlighting Black designers, which gives me inspiration and hope. It’s an example of how a community can foster equity and opportunities for those who have been overlooked in the design world. My exposure to graphic design also came from my own community. Although many of the exhibits that Harris talks about are no longer showing, this article, published in 2018, reminded me of the importance of appreciating and supporting those who advocate on your behalf. It highlights how I can give back to my community in the future and support it in the present.
                
                This article felt very personal to me, not only because it discusses being Black in a competitive field but also because it was published by AFROPUNK. AFROPUNK is an organization that aims to amplify the voices and performances of alternative Black artists and musicians. From 2005 up until the pandemic, AFROPUNK would host larger festivals in major metropolitan cities like New York City, Atlanta, and DC. Due to its social media presence, it became viral and established itself as an iconic cultural space for the alternative African diaspora. For me, AFROPUNK was actually one of my first introductions to the New York art scene, and it was gratifying to see an article published by them in this reading.
